## 🏰 About the Game
DAD is a **choice-based AI-driven role-playing game** inspired by classic tabletop RPGs like D&D, but with an AI twist! You embark on adventures, make decisions, and let the game dynamically generate the story around your actions. Your choices matter, and for those uncertain moments, a **d20 dice roll** decides your fate!

But unlike traditional RPGs, **the story can be anything** – fantasy, sci-fi, horror, slice-of-life – you decide! You can play as **any character** from movies, TV shows, games, anime, or even create yourself, your friends, or an entirely new character from your imagination.
