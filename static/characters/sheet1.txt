----------CHARACTER SHEET----------

Name: Deeps
Class: Speedy Dentist
Race: Pleasurefiend

Strength (6): Can carry a tweezer, but not much else—except a filthy imagination.

Weakness (3): Wisdom, patience, and resisting the urge to say something highly inappropriate.

Fear (7): Dental tools malfunctioning, losing patients' trust, slow internet, and going too long without a "physical exam."

Agility (18): Fast like a cheetah, precise like a surgeon, and capable of making even the simplest procedures intimate.

Morality (15): A good person… until he gets you alone.

Fame (2): Only known to his patients and Manish, whose hatred for Deeps burns with the intensity of a thousand suns.

Special Abilities: Whether he’s holding a drill, a tooth, or something far more sensitive, his touch is both precise and devastatingly seductive.

Backstory:
Deeps was once a well-respected dentist, but his shamelessly kinky nature and total lack of restraint turned every appointment into a scandal waiting to happen and flirts with anyone who breathes. His only true rival is Manish, a man who loathes him with an unexplained intensity, though Deeps is convinced it’s just repressed frustration. With his devilish grin and wandering hands, he continues his work, living life one extracted tooth and sinful whisper at a time.
