Backstory:
Yurei was once a skilled hitman, but after her cat Aki was killed by A-Train, she snapped. In a rage, she took down every superhero on the planet, including A-Train, but the pain of losing Aki still haunts her. Now, she carries Aki's stuffed skin everywhere, talks to it like it's alive, and takes it on "adventures" around the city, convinced that her beloved cat is still by her side.
