Backstory:
Once a brilliant scientist, Zappina's obsession with Nikola Tesla's work and her own dark magic led her down a path of destruction and chaos, using her genius-level intellect to create inventions that can change the course of human history, but instead, she chooses to use them to burn the world to ashes, all while her idol, Nikola Tesla, watches from the shadows, probably face-palming at her antics.
